## **INTRODUCTION**
The digital landscape is witnessing a rise in challenges which calls for novel refinement of Intrusion Detection Systems. There have been several concerns raised about the security of the Internet of Things expansion. IoT is enhanced by the use of blockchain technology that affirms the security and authenticity of digital nodes within a network. This combination has revolutionized several operational aspects in addition to making data management clear and unchangeable. Furthermore, increased networked device’s confidence and sense of trust have led to severe cyber attacks too. A potent defence against cyberattacks has to be created for the IoT environment. To avoid security threats of the devices connected to one another in an IoT system, a hybrid model of Intrusion Detection System that integrates ML and DL at different IoT layers is presented. The DL algorithms at the application layer help to improve overall security by detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts and network layer’s ML algorithms for examining network data to separate dangerous packets from benign packets, enhancing the system’s capacity to react to changing threats. IoT ecosystems can be better protected against a variety of cyber incursions by integrating ML and DL models thereby improving the accuracy of non-malicious users in the IoT system.

## **Dataset Description**
The fusion based machine learning IDS on the network layer employs three distinct
datasets such as CICIoT 2023, CIC-ToN IoT, and X-IIoTID. These three datasets
provide a diverse range of network traffic patterns and hence the IDS can learn
through a variety of scenarios. The dataset that is employed for the deep learning
model for malicious smart contract prediction is a self curated dataset. An abundant
volume of Ethereum transaction data from Google BigQuery was analyzed carefully
to extract the bytecode and smart contract addresses. Later Etherscan API was utilized
to retrieve the relevant smart contract code. The dataset offers a full perspective of
smart contract behavior and security, with findings from vulnerability detection tools
as the target variable and opcodes extracted from the smart contract code as features.
After a thorough preprocessing, the dataset-which started out with 470,000
records—was reduced to about 96,000 records that were judged appropriate for
additional examination. The data generated serves as the groundwork for the crafting
of strong deep learning models that are intended to improve blockchain security.
