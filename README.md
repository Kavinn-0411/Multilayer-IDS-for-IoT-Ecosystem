## **INTRODUCTION**
The digital landscape is witnessing a rise in challenges which calls for novel refinement of Intrusion Detection Systems. There have been several concerns raised about the security of the Internet of Things expansion. IoT is enhanced by the use of blockchain technology that affirms the security and authenticity of digital nodes within a network. This combination has revolutionized several operational aspects in addition to making data management clear and unchangeable. Furthermore, increased networked device’s confidence and sense of trust have led to severe cyber attacks too. A potent defence against cyberattacks has to be created for the IoT environment. To avoid security threats of the devices connected to one another in an IoT system, a hybrid model of Intrusion Detection System that integrates ML and DL at different IoT layers is presented. The DL algorithms at the application layer help to improve overall security by detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts and network layer’s ML algorithms for examining network data to separate dangerous packets from benign packets, enhancing the system’s capacity to react to changing threats. IoT ecosystems can be better protected against a variety of cyber incursions by integrating ML and DL models thereby improving the accuracy of non-malicious users in the IoT system.
